# Mimir Overview

Mimir was chosen as the name for this project as he is the God of knowledge and wisdom.
I hope to create a site that contains a number of resources to help improve at least the
knowledge part.  

The site currently contains useful resources for cooking and exercising.  
Hopefully more coming soon!

## Cooking
To access recipes and other cooking resources select the dropdown next to cooking in the menu
and select the resource you want to access.  
Alternatively [click here](Cooking/Introduction) 
to access the first resource.

## Exercise
To access resources for exercising select the dropdown next to exercise in the menu
and select the resource you want to access.  
Alternatively [click here](Exercise/Introduction)
