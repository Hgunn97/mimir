# Butternut Squash and Chesse Risotto
__Serves four__

## Ingredients
- 1 Butternut Squash
- 75g Butter
- 325ml Dry White Wine
- 50ml Olive Oil
- 1.5l Vegetable stock
- 1 Onion  
- 1 Clove Garlic
- 0.5 tsp Sage
- 400g Risotto Rice
- 150g Goats' Cheese
- 50g Parmesan

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C.
2. Peel the squash and cut in half lengthways. Scrape out the seeds and dice the whole squash into cubes.
3. Melt the butter in a large saucepan and add half of the squash. Cook gently for a few minutes, then add 150ml of the wine. Gently cook until the squash is very soft, about 20 minutes.
4. Place the remaining cubes of squash on a baking tray, drizzle with a little olive oil and place in the preheated oven. Roast until tender, about 20 minutes.
5. When the squash in the large saucepan is cooked, blend to a purée, season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool.
6. For the risotto, bring the stock to a low simmer. Place a tablespoon of olive oil in a large frying pan over a low-to-medium heat and gently cook the onion and sage for a few minutes until softened. Stir in the garlic and cook for a minute or so more.
7. Add the rice and stir for a few minutes. Add the remaining wine and keep stirring the rice until almost all the liquid bas been absorbed. Add some of the stock and stir continuously until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Repeat this process for about 15 minutes.
8. About 2 minutes before the rice is ready, stir in the squash purée and crumble in the goat’s cheese.
9. Reheat the squash cubes and add the Parmesan to the risotto. To serve, top the risotto with the squash cubes from the oven.
